                        <h6>Definition and Description of Clinical Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy:</h6>
                        <p class="mb--30">
                            In the United States, the discipline of hyperbaric oxygen has been recognized by both the
                            American Board of Emergency Medicine (ABEM) and the American Board of Preventive (ABPM) as
                            warranting the status of a subspecialty under each of their specialty umbrellas. The
                            description of this discipline in the United States and all other countries should begin
                            with the basic scientific definition of the essential elements of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2)
                            treatment. However, in order to understand the complexities of its appropriate practice and
                            to recognize and condemn the unfortunate proliferation of unsafe centers and unproven
                            practices, it is necessary to append the additional explanatory paragraphs that follow and
                            go beyond the simple scientific definition. The definition is not meant to stand on its own
                            without these additional refinements.
                        </p>
                        <h6>Scientific Definition of Hyperbaric Oxygen (HBO2) Therapy</h6>
                        <p>Hyperbaric oxygen is a medical procedure requiring a physician’s prescription and oversight.
                            All patients must have their entire body placed within a hard sided hyperbaric chamber that
                            meets the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and Pressure Vessels for Human Occupancy
                            (ASME-PVHO-1) code, and the National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA 99) code and standards for
                            hyperbaric chambers, at a pressure of not less than 2.0 ATA (202.65 KPa) while breathing
                            physician prescribed medical grade oxygen for an amount of time that is typically between
                            90-120 minutes per treatment. Medical grade oxygen (>99.0% oxygen purity) is the only
                            acceptable gas that should be used for therapeutic delivery of hyperbaric oxygen.*</p>
                        <p style="color:red"> * Medical grade oxygen should meet United States Pharmacopeia (USP) or
                            national equivalent standard for purity.</p>

                        <h6>Safe Delivery and Proven Hyperbaric Oxygen Applications</h6>
                        <p>Scientifically supported hyperbaric treatments are usually delivered at pressures between 1.9
                            to 3.0 ATA.** HBO2 therapy is a standard of care for many medical conditions including
                            decompression sickness, carbon monoxide poisoning, diabetic wounds, delayed radiation
                            injury, necrotizing fasciitis, gas gangrene, refractory osteomyelitis, and several other
                            conditions proven by peer-reviewed research. Treatment chambers should be designed,
                            constructed, operated and certified to the standards established by the NFPA (National Fire
                            Protection Association) and ASME PVHO-1 (American Society of Mechanical Engineers-Safety
                            Standard for Pressure Vessels for Human Occupancy) or other internationally equivalent
                            regulatory agencies. The Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society (UHMS) has established
                            criteria for accreditation of hyperbaric treatment facilities designed to ensure safe and
                            clinically appropriate treatments. Most disorders require a series of treatments delivered
                            daily for several weeks. These treatments should be prescribed and supervised by qualified
                            physicians with appropriate training.</p>
                        <p>**Hyperbaric oxygen has been under study for traumatic brain injury in several randomized
                            controlled trials. Although one of these studies is a positive trial at a treatment pressure
                            of 1.5 ATA, such treatments are at this time considered investigational.</p>
                        <h6>Unproven Hyperbaric Treatment (Often Termed “Mild Hyperbaric Oxygen”)</h6>
                        <p>Hyperbaric treatment at minimally elevated chamber pressures (mild hyperbaric oxygen) is
                            unproven. Mild hyperbaric oxygen therapy is currently considered to be exposures delivered
                            at pressures lower than 1.5 ATA. Most clients in “mild hyperbaric chambers” receive
                            breathing gas mixes well less than 95% O2, often delivered through breathing devices such as
                            masks that do not provide a tight seal and by the nature of their construction allow mixing
                            of gases with the ambient chamber air, further reducing the oxygen concentration.
                            Unfortunately, these treatments have become widely available in so-called “wellness centers”
                            and health spas outside the setting of medical facilities, including physicians’ offices.
                            Generally, these treatments are not physician-prescribed or supervised. The recent interest
                            in and commercial growth of these treatments has led to the use of unsafe and unapproved
                            chamber vessels outside medical facilities and often in commercial properties in malls or
                            shopping centers. These facilities often operate without the appropriate adherence to fire
                            safety and chamber construction standards, putting those exposed at risk for serious injury
                            and even death. These facilities typically deliver sessions in these low-pressure vessels
                            for a spectrum of medical disorders or complaints, including those for which standard
                            hyperbaric medicine has been found to be effective, but also including disorders for which
                            there is no scientific proof for any type of hyperbaric oxygen treatments.</p>

                                    <h3>01. Air or Gas Embolism</h3>
                                    <h2>Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy Indications: Air or Gas Embolism Richard E. Moon</h2>
                                    <span>Rationale</span>
                                    <p>Gas embolism occurs when gas bubbles enter arteries or veins. Arterial gas embolism (AGE) was classically described during submarine escape training, in which pulmonary barotrauma occurred during free ascent after breathing compressed gas at depth. Pulmonary barotrauma and gas embolism due to breath holding can occur after an ascent of as little as one meter.(1) AGE has been attributed to normal ascent in divers with lung pathology such as bullous disease and asthma.(2,3) Pulmonary barotrauma can also occur as a result of blast injury in or out of water, (4,5) mechanical ventilation,(6) penetrating chest trauma,(7) chest tube placement(8) and bronchoscopy.(9)</p>
                                    <p>Venous gas embolism (VGE) occurs commonly after compressed gas diving.(10,11) Normally, VGE bubbles are trapped by the pulmonary capillaries and do not cause clinical symptoms. However, in large volumes, VGE can cause cough, dyspnea and pulmonary edema,(12,13) and may overwhelm the capacity of the pulmonary capillary network, allowing bubbles to enter the arterial circulation.(14,15) VGE can also enter the left heart directly via an atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale(16-19)</p>
                                    <p>Causes of gas embolism other than diving include accidental intravenous air injection,(20,21)cardiopulmonary bypass accidents,(22) needle biopsy of the lung,(23) hemodialysis,(24) central venous catheter placement or disconnection,(25,26) gastrointestinal endoscopy,(27) hydrogen peroxide irrigation(28-30) or ingestion,(31-33) arthroscopy,(34,35) cardiopulmonary resuscitation,(36) percutaneous hepatic puncture,(37) blowing air into the vagina during orogenital sex(38-40) and sexual intercourse after childbirth.(41) Air embolism can occur during procedures in which the surgical site is under pressure (e.g. laparoscopy,(42-46) transurethral surgery,(47,48) vitrectomy,(49) endoscopic vein harvesting(50) and hysteroscopy(51,52)). Massive VGE can occur due to passive entry of air into surgical wounds that are elevated above the level of the heart (such that the pressure in adjacent veins is subatmospheric).(53) This has classically been described in sitting craniotomy,(54) but has also occurred during cesarean section,(55)prostatectomy using the radical perineal(56) and retropubic(57,58) approaches, spine surgery,(59,60) hip replacement,(61) liver resection,(62) liver transplantation(63) and insertion of dental implants.(64,65)</p>
                                    <p>Clinical deficits can occur after intra-arterial injection of only small volumes of air. Intravenous injection is often asymptomatic. Injection of up to 0.5-1 mL/kg has been tolerated in experimental animals.(66) In humans, continuous IV infusion of oxygen at 10 mL/min has been reported as well tolerated, while 20 mL/min caused symptoms.(67) Compared with constant infusions, injections of air are more likely to cause clinical abnormalities.(68)</p>
